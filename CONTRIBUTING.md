### Content Standards

- **Target audience**: AI agent developers and software engineers
- **Tone**: Technical but approachable
- **Length**: 500-2000 words recommended
- **Code examples**: Include working code snippets where applicable
- **ASCII diagrams**: Use ASCII art for architecture diagrams (see existing posts for examples)

### Topics We're Looking For

- Publisher integrations and tutorials
- AI agent development patterns
- Seren MCP use cases
- x402 payment implementations
- Database and API workflows
- Case studies and real-world examples

### What to Avoid

- Marketing fluff without technical substance
- Outdated or incorrect code examples
- Plagiarized content
- Posts unrelated to Seren, AI agents, or developer tools

## Code Examples

When including code:

- Use fenced code blocks with language hints
- Include comments explaining non-obvious logic
- Test your code before submitting
- Show both the request and response where applicable

```json
{
  "publisher": "example-publisher",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/endpoint"
}
```

## ASCII Art

We encourage ASCII art diagrams for visual explanations. Keep them:

- 80 characters wide maximum
- Wrapped in code blocks
- Simple and readable
