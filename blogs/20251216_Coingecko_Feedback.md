Hey, it would be really good if you give more time for the team to review it next time, it's public holiday and year end holidays for the team here. 

I took a look at the content, unfortunately it doesn't quite make sense for us to amplify it, based on similar reasons I shared above. Hope you can understand. 

Will let Brian review and comment, when he's back at work.

Hey @taariqlewis thanks for your patience. To help us support each other more smoothly going forward, here are a few cadences and guidelines we’d like to align on:

1. Review lead time
Please give the CoinGecko team at least 4 working days’ lead time to review and provide feedback on any co-marketing materials before they go live.

2. Brand and positioning
In general, we’d appreciate the following being respected:

- Logo usage: When featuring our logo, please use the “CoinGecko API” logo and follow our brand guidelines here: https://brand.coingecko.com/visual-identity/logo/combination-mark

- Clear positioning: Since SerenAI is reselling CoinGecko API data, we need the positioning to be clear to avoid misleading implications. We’re happy to amplify/co-market when the content clearly distinguishes CoinGecko API vs SerenAI’s x402 option — i.e., x402 can be a more financially viable option for low-volume users, while CoinGecko API plans makes more sense for high-volume usage and/or production apps.

Your previous material didn’t make this distinction clearly and could be read as “CoinGecko API is always the more expensive option,” which isn’t necessarily accurate. In those cases, it wouldn’t make sense for us to amplify/co-market the content.

- Messaging focus: We’re generally more open to co-marketing content that isn’t framed purely around cost comparisons (e.g., “SerenAI is 5x cheaper than CoinGecko API”), and instead emphasizes the right use case and value — for example:
“Our pay-per-call CoinGecko API x402 Gateway is ideal for AI agents and low-volume users to access CoinGecko’s crypto market data without committing to a monthly subscription.”

Overall, we’re keen to support x402 integrators when the positioning is clear and mutually beneficial, so we can both win without putting either party in a negative light.
